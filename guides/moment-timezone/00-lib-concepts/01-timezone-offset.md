title: Time Zone vs Offset
---

Frequently, people are confused about the difference between time zones and UTC offsets. 

The core Moment.js documentation has [a guide on this topic](/guides/#/lib-concepts/timezone-offset/) that is worth reading first.
Logically it belongs in the guides for Moment Timezone, but it predates this guide section by many years, and moving it would break a lot of links on the internet.
